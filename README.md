# A11yDatabase

We've got a few things here

- DBeaver collaboration files
- Database dump files
- Dockerfile to build custom A11yDatabase container
- Other funzies

This docker container is part of the whole Equalify package, but you can deploy it as a stand alone if you so choose. We split it out into its own container because there are alot of things... we will probably move over to the standard postgres:15 and then sql commands, but trying this way for now.
